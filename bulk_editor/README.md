As we change the data structures and templates of existing pages weâ€™ll need to bulk edit the existing pages. This script is a template you can use to perform such an operation. Modify it for your purposes.

Because these bulk edits are generally one-time operations, this repository is not seeking to keep a collection of every bulk edit script in the master branch. Keep your modification to this script on a different branch, and only bring in novel improvements to error handling, etc. to the master branch.

This script was originally written to edit all pages in the Modules category, to replace a parameter in the template with a couple new ones. The script first looks at all pages in the category and figures out which ones need to be modified, then modifies the identified pages using specific criteria.
